## Description
This is a multiplayer remake of the classic arcade game: Asteroids, made with pure javascript, using websockets. This project was my way to learn a bit about websockets.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run ``` npm run start ``` in your terminal.
3. Visit the webserver and enjoy the game by yourserf or with others.
